Current assumptions that Bisbat makes:

1.  Game environment is non-agressive
2.  Time is not a factor
3.  You can return to any place we have been before
        * This is a logical postulate, not an unchecked situation
4.  Rooms cannot link to themselves.
5. Game environment is constant. Places/Exits do not disappear/appear
6. Mobiles with the same long description are the same.
7. Items with the same long description are the same.


What can Bisbat currently do:

1. Wander randomly.
2. Knows how rooms he has been to connect to eachother.
3. Discover the name of a mobile that he sees.
