Current assumptions that Bisbat makes:

1. Exits are bidirectional. (e.g. going "east" then "west" returns him to where he just was).
2. Rooms can be uniquely identified by title, description, and exit directions/doors.
3. There are no "beings" or "objects" in the world.
4. Game environment is non-agressive
5. Time is not a factor
6. All door are closed (and need opening)
7. You can return to any place we have been before
   * This is a logical postulate, not an unchecked situation
8. Rooms cannot link to themselves.
9. Going from one room in one direction will not lead back to that room. (spatial location).


What can Bisbat currently do:

1. Wonder randomly.
2. Knows how rooms he has been to connect to eachother.
